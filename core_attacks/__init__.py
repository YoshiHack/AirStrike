# AirStrike/core_attacks/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'core_attacks' directory a Python package.
# It can be left empty.

# You might choose to import your attack worker functions here
# to make them available via 'from core_attacks import deauth_attack_worker',
# but it's often cleaner to import them directly from their respective modules
# in the attack_service.py file.
